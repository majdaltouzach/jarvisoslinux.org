# JARVIS OS Website — Claude Context

## Project overview
This is the official website for **JARVIS OS**, an Arch Linux-based AI-native operating system
built as a research project at **Washington State University (WSU Everett)** by Yakup and
co-author Toufic Majdaleni, under a WSU research grant. The project is being presented at
**SURCA** (Showcase for Undergraduate Research and Creative Activities) and is heading toward
a full academic paper.

The website lives at the **`jarvisos` GitHub organization** and is hosted via GitHub Pages.

## What JARVIS OS is
- Arch Linux base + KDE Plasma 6 on Wayland
- **Ollama** for local LLM inference (no cloud dependencies)
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** orchestration layer — lets the LLM autonomously create,
  modify, and delete system tools with sudo access
- Built to empirically study security threats that emerge when LLMs gain OS-level privileges
- Seven-script modular build pipeline that transforms a base Arch ISO into a bootable AI-native OS
- Calamares installer for permanent installation

## Research core — the seven-threat taxonomy
Derived from direct experience building and operating JARVIS OS:
1. Misinterpreted MCP keyword search
2. Misleading MCP server usage
3. Unverified community MCP servers
4. Unauthorized sudo requests via MCP
5. Sudo capability exploitation
6. Unintended file modification/deletion
7. **Forgetful context** — LLMs silently drop previously stated security constraints
   mid-session. **Novel finding with no prior literature.** Always emphasize this one.

Three privilege escalation tiers studied: (1) sandboxed/user-level, (2) sudo/elevated,
(3) web-enabled.

## Website tech stack
- **Astro** — static site framework, pages as `.astro` files
- **GitHub Pages** deployment via `jarvisos.github.io`
- **GitHub API** — used for live data: releases, contributors, repo stats
- No backend, no build-time secrets required
- Styling: custom CSS (dark, industrial, cyan accent aesthetic — see `index.html` for the
  design language already established)

## Design language (already established)
- Dark theme: `#07090f` background, `#00c8ff` cyan accent, `#f0a500` gold for warnings
- Fonts: `Chakra Petch` (headings), `DM Mono` (code/labels), `DM Sans` (body)
- Grid overlay background, scan line animations, bordered cards
- Severity labels: Critical (red), High (gold), Medium (cyan), Novel (green)
- Tone: technical, research-credible, not marketing fluff

## Site structure — pages to build
```
/               Home — hero, features overview, architecture diagram, download CTA
/download       Releases, ISO download, SHA-512 checksum, mirrors, install instructions
/subsystems     Each component of the project explained, links to their GitHub repos
/research       Threat taxonomy (all 7), SURCA poster, paper abstract, methodology
/docs           Getting started, build system walkthrough (the 7 scripts explained)
/contributors   Team (Yakup + Toufic) + GitHub API contributors list
```

## Subsystems to showcase on /subsystems
Each subsystem should link to its own repo under the `jarvisos` GitHub org:
- **jarvis-core** — the AI daemon and CLI (`jarvis` command)
- **mcp-servers** — the MCP orchestration layer and tool registry
- **calamares-config** — the Calamares installer configuration package
- **jarvisos** (main) — the 7-script build pipeline (01 through 07 scripts)

---

## Key framing notes (important for copy/content)
- The project's academic contribution is the **platform + threat taxonomy**, not just the software
- JARVIS OS **outperforms OpenClaw** in context preservation and task management
- Traditional OS security models are **inadequate for probabilistic AI agents** — this is the
  central thesis
- "Forgetful context" (threat #7) is the standout novel finding — lead with it in research contexts
- The project is accurately described as **ongoing** — empirical results are forthcoming
- Framing: research platform first, cool Linux distro second

## GitHub org structure
```
github.com/jarvisos/
├── jarvisos            ← main build system (the 7 scripts)
├── jarvis-core         ← AI daemon + CLI

## Conventions
- Keep pages modular — shared nav and footer as Astro components
- Pull release data from GitHub API at build time so download page always shows latest ISO
- Contributors page fetches from GitHub API (don't hardcode contributor lists)
- All internal links use Astro's file-based routing
- Docs pages written in Markdown (`.md`) inside `src/content/docs/`
